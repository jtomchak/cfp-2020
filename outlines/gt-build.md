# How I ended up building a CICD from scratch

# Abstract (500 words, what they will learn from your talk and why they care about it)

Through a course of events and decisions, I've ended up with my own continuous build and publish site using Gatsby. I know what you're thinking because I have the same thought daily. Why on earth would you do that? Doesn't he know about Netlify, Zeit? Has he not heard [name any of a dozen tools here] that will do that for you? I have and I tried. I wanted a few requirements that lead me down this path. We'll get into specifics a bit later, but I want to share with you what I've learned along the way including building my first plugin for gatsby and more.
