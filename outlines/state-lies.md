# Your State is Lying to You


# Abstract (600 char, what they will learn from your talk and why they care about it)
We've got global state, component state, state in a store, app-level state, state in context, its a very delicate balance of what is true now, what has happened, and what’s possible in the future. State can notably be the most complex, difficult part of any application. I am here to break the difficult news to you that your state has been lying to you this whole time. Now, these are not full outrageous lies, no. They are dozens and dozens of little white lies, sometimes just an omission of the truth. Of what is actually going on in your program. 
There is a path to reform, for even the most misbehaved state. I’ll expose how your state has been fudging the truth, making you and your team’s life more difficult. Once we know exactly what’s going on, we’ll explore some ideas to keep state on the straight and narrow.
